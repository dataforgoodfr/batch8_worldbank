# World Bank Disaster Dashboard

The goal of this projet is to 

-   predict future disasters ([droughts](https://github.com/dataforgoodfr/batch8_worldbank/tree/master/model_secheresse), [floods](https://github.com/dataforgoodfr/batch8_worldbank/tree/master/model_innondations), and [storms](https://github.com/dataforgoodfr/batch8_worldbank/tree/master/model_tempetes)) and their impact,
-   represent these predictions on a [dashboard](https://github.com/dataforgoodfr/batch8_worldbank/tree/master/Dashboard).

[Here](./DemoDaySlides20201217.pdf) you can find some slides which presented the project on Data for Good demo day (December 17th 2020).
